# Load_Forecasting

Power Load Forecasting in two test sites using Decision Trees, Neural Networks and CRBM's.

#Data Preprocessing

1. Data is spread out at specific time intervals by removing close data points and linear interpolation.
2. Data points are split into days of the week and also holidays and working days

# Implementation

1. Matlab's Bagged Decision Trees functions and Neural Network toolboxes are used.
2. CRBM code is writted in matlab. (It takes a long time to train)

# Results

1. The forecasted data is plotted and compared for both the test sites using the three algorithms.
